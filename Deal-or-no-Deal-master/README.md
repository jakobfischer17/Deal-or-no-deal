In collaboration with jakobfischer17
My second university project made using Rails and Sinatra

    Extract the contents from the “dond” zip folder (important: please do not rename or delete any of the contents of this folder) 2. install Ruby version 2.4.1 or higher (follow instructions on: https://www.rubylang.org/en/downloads/) or use an integrated service such as Cloud9
    Install the latest version of the following gems (visit http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/ on how to install gems): i. bcrypt ii. bond iii. dm-sqlite-adapter iv. haml v. ripl vi. ripl-multi_line vii. fileutils viii. pp ix. ripl-rack x. rspec xi. sinatra xii. sinatra/activerecord xiii. sqlite3 xiv. tux
    Open a new terminal in Cloud9 (or a a new Terminal/Powershell/command prompt window) and navigate to the extracted “dond” folder 5. Run the program: a. For Cloud 9: enter “ruby wad_dond_run_01.rb –p $PORT –o $IP” without the quotes and click on the link that pops up b. Locally: run “wad_dond_run_01.rb” by typing “ruby wad_dond_run_01.rb” without the quotes into your command line application and open http://localhost:4567 in a web browser for the web based version of the game
